# Weather Info App üå¶Ô∏è  

A modern and user-friendly weather application designed to fetch real-time weather data using the Open Weather API. It uses the device's current location or a user-selected district (Zila) to display detailed weather information. The app is built using **Clean Architecture** principles and follows the **MVVM pattern** to ensure scalability and maintainability.

## üåü Features  

- **Current Weather**: Displays weather details such as temperature, condition, and icon based on the device's location.  
- **Search Functionality**: Users can search for districts (Zilas) and view their weather details.  
- **Dynamic Suggestions**: The search bar dynamically suggests matching Zilas as you type.  
- **Modern UI**: Designed with **Material 3** to provide an intuitive and responsive experience.

### Project Setup
Clone the project and open it using Android Studio. Then open your `local.properties` file under `Gradle Scripts`. You need to specify the `APP_ID` in your `local.properties` file. Store your API secret in plain string file or Kotlin file is very risky. For security purpose it's better store in local.properties file than plain string/Kotlin file.

#### Use Sample API without creating account
Add below lines at the end of your `local.properties` file. Then run the project. You'll get dummy or static API response from Open Weather API.
```properties

#this is sample App ID of Open Weather API
APP_ID=b6907d289e10d714a6e88b30761fae22
```
#### Use Real APP ID after sign up and activation of your APP ID
After Sign up at the website collect your own `APP ID` from their [API Keys page](https://home.openweathermap.org/api_keys). Then add below lines with your APP ID at the end of `local.properties` file.
```properties

#this is real App ID of Open Weather API
APP_ID=YOUR_OWN_APP_ID
```
The APP ID will be fetched from the `build.gradle` file and stored in `BuildConfig`. The `Retrofit` API call will use the APP ID from `BuildConfig`.
